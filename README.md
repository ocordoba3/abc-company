# React + Vite + TypeScript App

This project is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript.

# Getting Started

To run the project in development mode, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Features

## Data Management

The application uses [Fake API](https://jsoning.com/api/) to provide and manage data.

## API Requests & State Management

All API requests are handled using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). Since React Query also manages data state, additional state management tools like Zustand or Context API are not required.

## Component Library

The UI components are built with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/). Its DataGrid component provides powerful filtering, sorting and pagination functionalities for data display.

## Styling & Icons

Styles are managed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Icons are provided by [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
